      Arrietty and her parents are known as 'borrowers' because, being tiny, they often 'borrow' items from the humans' house, 
      where they live beneath the floorboards. One day, Shawn, a sick boy who lives in the house, discovers and befriends Arrietty. 
      However, their friendship could bring trouble for Arrietty and her family.

     A young girl named Chihiro and her parents stumble upon a mysterious spirit world, where her parents are transformed into pigs after eating food meant for the spirits. To survive and save them, Chihiro is forced to give up her name to a powerful witch who runs a bathhouse for the gods and spirits that pass through. As she works there, Chihiro receives help from Haku, a boy with a hidden past, and forms unlikely friendships with the strange and magical beings around her. Through her journey, she faces difficult trials, slowly grows braver, and begins to uncover the secrets of the spirit world.

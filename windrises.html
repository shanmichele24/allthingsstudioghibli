     Jiro meets Nahoko during an earthquake that hits her hometown. He helps her and her maid get to safety, but they get separated afterward, and he’s left wondering what happened to her. Years later, Jiro is working as a plane engineer with his friend Honjo, and they’re sent to Germany to study aircraft design so they can build bombers back in Japan. After returning home, Jiro runs into Nahoko again by chance, and they reconnect. As their relationship grows, Nahoko becomes seriously ill with tuberculosis. While Jiro is busy working on his fighter plane project, he also tries to be there for her, doing his best to balance his dream with the love and care she needs.

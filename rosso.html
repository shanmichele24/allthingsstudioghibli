    During World War I, pilot Marco Pagot gets cursed and turns into a pig after losing faith in humanity. Now stuck as a humanoid pig, he works as a bounty hunter, flying through dangerous missions in the skies. With his skills as a pilot, Marco makes plenty of enemies—other sky pilots and rival bounty hunters who all want to take him down. As he deals with this weird new life, Marco has to figure out his sense of purpose, deal with his past, and try to hold on to his humanity while facing those who are out to stop him.

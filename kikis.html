  <p>A young witch named Kiki sets off with her talking cat, Jiji, to start her training and live on her own for the first time. She ends up in a town where a kind bakery owner and her husband take her in and give her a place to stay. With their help, she starts a flying delivery service using her broom. At first, things go well, but Kiki soon starts to struggle with self-doubt and loses her magic. As she faces the ups and downs of growing up, she learns to trust herself and find her path.

      Umi is a high school girl who helps take care of her family while living in a house by the sea. One day, she meets Shun, a guy who’s trying to save their school’s old clubhouse from being torn down. As they work together, they start to realize that their families are connected in a surprising way, which brings them even closer. As they figure things out, they deal with their own challenges, grow up a little, and try to make sense of their feelings for each other.

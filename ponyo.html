       A little fish named Ponyo dreams of becoming human after meeting a young boy named Sosuke. When she escapes her underwater home, she magically transforms into a human girl, but her newfound powers start to cause chaos, flooding the world above and throwing nature out of balance. As the ocean rises and massive storms threaten to overwhelm the land, Sosuke and Ponyo team up to find a way to restore harmony before everything is lost.

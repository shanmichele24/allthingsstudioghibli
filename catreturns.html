  Haru is just an ordinary girl,until she saves a cat from getting hit by a car. Turns out, the cat’s actually a prince from the Cat Kingdom, and as a thank-you, his royal family decides she should marry him. Before she knows it, Haru’s taken to the Cat Kingdom, starts turning into a cat herself, and realizes she really needs to get out of there.

With the help of Muta, a grumpy but loyal cat, and the Baron, a cool, gentlemanly cat statue who comes to life, Haru goes on a wild adventure to escape the wedding, become human again, and find her way back home.

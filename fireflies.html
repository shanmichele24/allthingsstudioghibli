   A teenage boy named Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they try to survive on their own in Japan during the final days of World War II. After losing their home and family, they struggle to find food and shelter, moving from place to place just trying to stay alive. The animation is beautiful, and the story is simple but incredibly powerful, focusing on their bond and the small moments they share in the middle of everything falling apart.

      <p>A young girl with a mysterious crystal teams up with a boy to find the truth behind a long-lost floating city. As they travel through stunning landscapes, they run into weird creatures, tricky traps, and powerful enemies who don’t want the city’s secrets getting out. Along the way, the two grow closer and learn to rely on each other, using their different strengths to get through all the challenges. As they dig deeper, they start to uncover the crystal’s past and realize their lives are more connected to the city then they thought.</p>

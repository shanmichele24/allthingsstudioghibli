        When the Witch of the Waste turns Sophie into an old lady, she ends up in the middle of nowhere and finds Howl’s strange, magical moving castle. She decides to stick around and becomes his cleaning lady, even though she’s hiding the fact that she’s under a curse. Inside the castle, she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who's tied to Howl’s heart, and the two quickly become friends. As Sophie spends more time with Howl, she falls for him and tries to save him from himself.

Shizuku, a curious and creative teenage girl who loves reading and dreams of writing her own stories someday. As she starts to question what she really wants out of life, she stumbles on a mystery—someone keeps checking out all the same library books before her. That small detail leads her to Seiji, a boy with big dreams of becoming a violin maker. Inspired by his determination, Shizuku decides to push herself and write her first story.
